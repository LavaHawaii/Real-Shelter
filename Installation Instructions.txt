NMM Users!
1. Install via Mod Manager

2. Move RSPatch.esp to the very bottom of your load order

3. Move RealShelter.esp as high up in your load order as you can, or let loot take care of it.  I usually place it before any mods that modify the land in any way. (Dungeon mods, city mods etc).

4. Goto Your Game Folder By Clicking:
